# AI Assistant for Rancher

## Architecture

The system is composed of a **UI Extension** for user interaction, a **ReAct Agent** for intelligent decision-making, and an **MCP Server** that acts as the intermediary between the agent and the Rancher API. 

### [ReAct Agent](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-ai-agent)

The **ReAct Agent** is the orchestrator of the system‚Äôs intelligence. It leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** as its **reasoning engine**, while the agent itself provides the structure, coordination, and secure execution of actions.

#### üß† LLM (Reasoning Engine)
- Interprets user inputs expressed in natural language.  
- Performs the **reasoning**: breaks down complex requests into smaller steps.  
- Decides what should happen next (keep reasoning vs. take action).  
- Synthesizes outputs from tools into clear, human-readable responses.  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Agent (Orchestrator)
- Wraps the LLM with the **ReAct (Reason + Act)**
- Decides when to let the LLM keep reasoning or when to **act** on its instructions.  
- Calls external tools (via the MCP Server) as directed by the LLM.  
- Ensures secure interactions by passing the user‚Äôs Rancher token to the MCP server for authentication and authorization.  

#### [MCP Server](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-ai-mcp)

The **MCP Server** acts as a secure, controlled gateway between the ReAct Agent and the Rancher and Kubernetes APIs. Its functions include:

  * **Exposing Tools**: It provides a set of well-defined, safe tools (API endpoints) that the ReAct Agent can call. These tools abstract away the complexity of direct Rancher/Kubernetes API interactions.
  * **Interaction with Rancher**: It translates tool calls from the agent into the appropriate API requests to the Rancher management server, retrieving or modifying resources as needed.

### UI Extension

The **UI Extension** provides the user-facing chat interface within the Rancher dashboard. It is designed to be a seamless part of the Rancher experience and is responsible for:

  * **User Input**: It captures user queries and sends them to the ReAct Agent.
  * **Displaying Responses**: It receives responses from the ReAct Agent and presents them in a chat-like format.

## How It Works (Flow)

1. **User Request ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí LLM**  
   The user submits a natural language query through the UI Extension.  
2. **LLM Reasoning**  
   The LLM interprets the request, reasons about the problem, and proposes a plan.  
3. **Agent Acting**  
   If the plan requires external operations, the agent calls the appropriate MCP Server tools.  
4. **LLM Response Formulation**  
   The LLM takes the tool outputs and crafts a coherent, human-readable response.  
5. **Response ‚Üí User**  
   The answer is returned to the user through the UI Extension.  

## Installation

- **No Helm chart package is currently available.** You'll need to clone the repository and use the `chart` directory to install the application.
- **Configure your LLM provider.** You must set one of the following in `values.yaml`: `ollamaUrl`, `googleApiKey`, or `openaiApiKey`. The `llmModel` variable must also be specified.
- **Run the Helm command:** Execute `helm install ai-agent chart --namespace cattle-ai-agent-system --create-namespace`. The application must be installed in the `cattle-ai-agent-system` namespace.
- The temporary UI is available at https://yourRancherURl/api/v1/namespaces/cattle-ai-agent-system/services/http:rancher-ai-agent:80/proxy/agent. This will change once the UI extension is available.
